- **Lasso Regression**
- **Random Forest Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regression**

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DhairyaPatel1911/House-Price-Prediction.git

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains features such as the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant information. The target variable is the house price.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Scaling numerical features

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA includes:

Visualizing the distribution of features
Identifying correlations between features
Analyzing outliers and trends

## Models Used
The following regression models have been implemented:

- Linear Regression: A simple linear approach to predict house prices.
- Ridge Regression: A regularized linear model to avoid overfitting.
- Lasso Regression: Another regularization technique, useful for feature selection.
- Random Forest Regression: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve predictions.
- Decision Tree Regression: A tree-based model that splits the data into branches for prediction.

## Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) scores. The evaluation results help in comparing the accuracy of different models.
