## Project Overview
The project implements different regression models to predict house prices. The workflow includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training with various algorithms
- Model evaluation and comparison

The following models are used in this project:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Random Forest Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regression**
